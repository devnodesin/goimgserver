## Features Implemented

### ✅ Extension Auto-Detection
- Automatically finds files without specified extensions
- Searches in priority order: jpg/jpeg → png → webp
- Example: `/img/cat` → finds `cat.jpg`, `cat.png`, or `cat.webp`

### ✅ Extension Priority Order
- **Priority**: jpg/jpeg (highest) > png (medium) > webp (lowest)
- When multiple extensions exist, serves highest priority
- Example: If `profile.jpg`, `profile.png`, `profile.webp` exist → serves `profile.jpg`

### ✅ Grouped Image Support
- Organize images in folders with default fallback
- `/img/cats` → resolves to `cats/default.*`
- `/img/cats/cat_white` → resolves to `cats/cat_white.*`
- Supports extension auto-detection in groups

### ✅ Fallback Chain
Structured fallback system:
1. **Requested file** → Try exact file requested
2. **Group default** (grouped images only) → Try `{group}/default.*`
3. **System default** → Try `default.*` in root
4. **Error** → Return `ErrFileNotFound`

### ✅ Security Features
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Blocks `../` attempts
- **Absolute Path Rejection**: Rejects `/etc/passwd` style paths
- **Symlink Safety**: Only follows symlinks within image directory
- **Null Byte Protection**: Sanitizes `\x00` characters
- All security tests pass

### ✅ Performance Optimization
- Optional thread-safe caching mechanism
- Cache hits: **15.22 ns/op** (600x faster than filesystem)
- Uncached: **9,649 ns/op** (still very fast)
- Zero allocations for cache hits

### ✅ Concurrent Safety
- All operations are thread-safe
- Cache uses sync.RWMutex for concurrent access
- Tested with 50 concurrent goroutines

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process

### Phase 1: Red (Write Failing Tests)
✅ Created 16 core tests covering:
- Resolver creation
- Single image resolution (with/without extension)
- Extension priority
- Grouped image resolution
- Fallback behavior

### Phase 2: Green (Implement Minimal Code)
✅ Implemented resolver with:
- Extension detection logic
- Priority order algorithm
- Grouped image support
- Fallback chain

### Phase 3: Refactor (Optimize)
✅ Added security validation
✅ Implemented caching
✅ Optimized performance
✅ Improved test coverage

### Phase 4: Extend (Additional Features)
✅ Added 15 security tests
✅ Added cache tests
✅ Added benchmark tests
✅ Created documentation and examples

## API Design

### Simple and Clean API
```go
// Basic usage
resolver := resolver.NewResolver("/path/to/images")
result, err := resolver.Resolve("cat.jpg")

// With caching
resolver := resolver.NewResolverWithCache("/path/to/images")
result, err := resolver.Resolve("cat")

// Custom default
result, err := resolver.ResolveWithDefault("missing.jpg", "/path/to/default.jpg")
```

### Result Structure
```go
type ResolutionResult struct {
    ResolvedPath string   // Absolute path to file
    IsGrouped    bool     // Grouped image flag
    IsFallback   bool     // Fallback flag
    FallbackType string   // Fallback type if applicable
}
```
