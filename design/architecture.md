# goimgserver Architecture

## System Overview

The `goimgserver` is a high-performance image processing service designed for dynamic resizing, format conversion, and caching. The architecture follows modular design principles with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Components

### HTTP Layer (Gin Framework)
- **Router**: Handles routing and middleware chain
- **Endpoints**: Image processing and administrative commands
- **Middleware**: Security, logging, rate limiting, error handling

### Command System
- **Cache Management**: Clear operations and statistics
- **Git Operations**: Repository synchronization 
- **Administrative Tasks**: System maintenance commands

### Image Processing Pipeline
- **Resolution**: File discovery and validation
- **Processing**: Dynamic resizing and format conversion
- **Caching**: Intelligent storage and retrieval

### File System Integration
- **Images Directory**: Source image storage (supports Git repositories)
- **Cache Directory**: Processed image storage with intelligent cleanup

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security
1. **Input Validation**: Path sanitization, parameter validation
2. **Execution Controls**: Timeout protection, resource limits
3. **Access Controls**: Command endpoint protection, rate limiting

### Security Features
- Shell metacharacter detection
- Path traversal prevention
- Clean execution environment
- Audit logging

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Setup
- Reverse proxy integration (Nginx)
- Service management (systemd)
- Resource monitoring
- Log management

### Scalability
- Stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Efficient caching strategy
- Configurable resource limits

## Integration Points

- **Git Integration**: For image repository management
- **Cache System**: High-performance storage layer
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization hooks

This architecture supports high throughput image processing while maintaining security and operational simplicity.
