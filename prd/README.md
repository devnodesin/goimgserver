# GitHub Issues for goimgserver Implementation

This directory contains GitHub issues broken down into manageable, self-contained tasks for implementing the goimgserver image processing service using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

## TDD Implementation Approach

**MANDATORY**: All tasks must follow the Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle:

1. **ðŸ”´ RED**: Write failing tests first that define the desired behavior
2. **ðŸŸ¢ GREEN**: Write minimal code to make the tests pass
3. **ðŸ”µ REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### TDD Success Criteria for All Issues:
- [ ] All tests written before implementation code
- [ ] No production code without corresponding tests
- [ ] Test coverage >95% for each component
- [ ] Tests cover error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Implementation is minimal and focused on making tests pass

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)
- **gh-0002.md** - Core Application Configuration and Command-Line Arguments
- **gh-0003.md** - Image Processing Engine with bimg Integration
- **gh-0004.md** - Cache Management System
- **gh-0005.md** - Image Endpoint Implementation
- **gh-0014.md** - Default Image Fallback System

### Phase 2: Administrative Features (Medium Priority)
- **gh-0006.md** - Command Endpoints Implementation
- **gh-0007.md** - Pre-cache Initialization System
- **gh-0008.md** - HTTP Server Enhancement and Middleware
- **gh-0009.md** - Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging
- **gh-0013.md** - Security Hardening and Production Safety

### Phase 3: Quality & Production (Medium to Low Priority)
- **gh-0010.md** - Testing Suite Implementation
- **gh-0011.md** - Documentation and Deployment Guide
- **gh-0012.md** - Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## Dependencies

```
gh-0002 (Config) 
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0003 (Image Processing)
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0008 (HTTP Server)
â”‚
gh-0003 + gh-0004 (Cache) 
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0005 (Image Endpoints)
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0007 (Pre-cache)
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0014 (Default Image System)
â”‚
gh-0002 + gh-0004
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0006 (Command Endpoints)
â”‚
All Core (gh-0002 to gh-0007)
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0009 (Error Handling)
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0010 (Testing)
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0011 (Documentation)
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-0012 (Performance)
```

## Notes

- **gh-0014.md** is the default image fallback system (high priority for user experience)
- Each task is designed to be self-contained with clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies are clearly marked to ensure proper implementation order
- High priority tasks (gh-0002 through gh-0005, gh-0014) form the core functionality
- Medium priority tasks enhance the service for production use
- Low priority tasks focus on optimization and documentation

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 4-5 weeks (core functionality with comprehensive TDD + default image system)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 weeks (administrative features + security with TDD)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks (quality and production readiness with TDD)

Total estimated time: 9-12 weeks depending on team size and TDD experience.

**Note**: TDD adds initial development time but significantly reduces debugging, maintenance, and refactoring time. Default image system adds user experience value.
