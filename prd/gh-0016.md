# GitHub Issue: Repository Cleanup and Enhancements

## Description

This issue focuses on cleaning up and organizing the repository to improve maintainability and usability. The tasks include relocating or removing files, updating documentation, and creating a utility script for testing.

## Tasks

### 1. Review and relocate `/ARCHITECTURE.md`

- **Action**: Determine if `/ARCHITECTURE.md` is relevant and needed.
  - If relevant, move it to `/design/` with a proper name.
  - If not relevant, remove the file.
- **Cleanup**: Retain only essential usage details.
  - Remove implementation details and code examples.
  - Keep the document concise and focused.

### 2. Relocate and clean up `src/TESTING.md`

- **Action**: Move `src/TESTING.md` to `/docs/`.

- **Cleanup**: Retain only essential usage details.
  - Remove implementation details and code examples.
  - Keep the document concise and focused.

### 3. Create `run_test.sh` script

- **Location**: Place the script in the top-level directory.

- **Functionality**:
  - Execute all Go tests in the repository.
  - Provide a summary of the test results.
  - Ensure the script is easy to use for developers to verify code quality before pushing to the repository.

### 4. Clean up `/design/` and `/docs/`

- **Action**: Remove any unwanted or outdated files from the `/design/` and `/docs/` directories.

### 5. Review and update `README.md`

- **Action**: Review the top-level `README.md` file.
  - Update it if necessary to reflect the current state of the repository and its usage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/ARCHITECTURE.md` is either relocated or removed based on its relevance.
- [ ] `src/TESTING.md` is moved to `/docs/` and cleaned up.
- [ ] `run_test.sh` script is created and functions as described.
- [ ] Unwanted files are removed from `/design/` and `/docs/`.
- [ ] `README.md` is reviewed and updated if needed.

## Notes

- Ensure all changes are committed with clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Follow the repository's contribution guidelines and coding standards.
- Test the `run_test.sh` script to ensure it works as expected.
