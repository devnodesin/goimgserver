# Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## Summary
Implement performance optimizations, monitoring capabilities, and metrics collection for production deployment using Test-Driven Development (TDD) for measurable improvements.

## TDD Requirements
**MANDATORY**: Follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all performance implementations.

### Test-First Development Steps
1. **Red**: Write failing performance and monitoring tests with specific metrics
2. **Green**: Implement minimal optimizations to meet performance requirements
3. **Refactor**: Optimize further while maintaining performance benchmarks

### Required Tests (Write These First)
- [ ] `TestMemoryOptimization_ImageProcessing_MemoryUsage` - Test memory limits
- [ ] `TestMemoryOptimization_ImageProcessing_LeakDetection` - Test memory leak prevention
- [ ] `TestMemoryOptimization_CacheOperations_MemoryEfficiency` - Test cache memory usage
- [ ] `TestConnectionPooling_ResourceManagement_PoolSize` - Test connection pool efficiency
- [ ] `TestConnectionPooling_ResourceManagement_Cleanup` - Test resource cleanup
- [ ] `TestMetricsCollection_Prometheus_Endpoint` - Test metrics endpoint
- [ ] `TestMetricsCollection_Prometheus_Format` - Test Prometheus format compliance
- [ ] `TestMetricsCollection_CustomMetrics_Registration` - Test custom metrics
- [ ] `TestPerformanceMonitoring_ImageOperations_Timing` - Test operation timing
- [ ] `TestPerformanceMonitoring_ImageOperations_Throughput` - Test throughput metrics
- [ ] `TestCacheMonitoring_HitMissRatio_Tracking` - Test cache metrics

- [ ] `TestResponseTimeMonitoring_P95_Latency` - Test response time percentiles
- [ ] `TestResponseTimeMonitoring_P99_Latency` - Test high percentile latency
- [ ] `TestResourceMonitoring_CPU_Usage` - Test CPU usage monitoring
- [ ] `TestResourceMonitoring_Memory_Usage` - Test memory monitoring
- [ ] `TestConcurrentOptimization_WorkerPools_Efficiency` - Test worker pool optimization
- [ ] `TestConcurrentOptimization_WorkerPools_Scalability` - Test scalability
- [ ] `TestProfilingEndpoints_Pprof_Availability` - Test profiling endpoints
- [ ] `TestProfilingEndpoints_Pprof_Security` - Test profiling security

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **TDD Cycle**: All tests written before implementation code with specific performance targets
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for image processing with measurable limits
- [ ] Connection pooling and resource management with tested efficiency
- [ ] Metrics collection endpoint (Prometheus format) with validated output

- [ ] Response time monitoring with percentile calculations
- [ ] Memory and CPU usage monitoring with alerting thresholds
- [ ] Concurrent request handling optimization with measured throughput
- [ ] Resource cleanup and garbage collection optimization with leak detection
- [ ] Performance profiling endpoints (pprof) with secure access
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Achieve >95% test coverage for performance monitoring

## Technical Details
